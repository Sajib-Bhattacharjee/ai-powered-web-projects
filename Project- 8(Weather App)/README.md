## 📁 Code Structure

📌 **HTML (`index.html`)** – Defines the structure, including search bar, weather display, and forecast sections.

📌 **CSS (`style.css`)** – Handles styling, layout, animations, responsiveness, and dark/light mode.

📌 **JavaScript (`script.js`)** – Fetches data from the API, updates the DOM, and manages user interactions.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

🔴 **Weather Data Not Showing?**

- Ensure the API key is correctly pasted in `script.js`.
- Check the browser console for errors (e.g., Invalid API key, CORS issues).
- Verify the city name is valid and spelled correctly.

🔴 **Geolocation Not Working?**

- Ensure your browser supports geolocation and permissions are granted.
- Test the app on a **local server** to avoid CORS issues.

🔴 **API Rate Limit Exceeded?**

- The free tier allows **60 API calls per minute**. Wait a minute and try again.

🔴 **Dark/Light Mode Not Toggling?**

- Ensure `script.js` is correctly linked in `index.html`.
- Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console.
